# SparkifyDataModeling
This project performs data modeling for the Sparkify application data.

## Objective
1) Data needs to be modeled by creating tables in Apache Cassandra.
2) Through ETL pipeline transfer data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

## Project Details
Datasets
A dataset: event_data is provided. The directory contains CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:

event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv


you will process the event_datafile_new.csv dataset to create a denormalized dataset
you will model the data tables keeping in mind the queries you need to run
you have been provided queries that you will need to model your data tables for
you will load the data into tables you create in Apache Cassandra and run your queries
Project Steps
Below are steps you can follow to complete each component of this project.

Modeling your NoSQL database or Apache Cassandra database
Design tables to answer the queries outlined in the project template
Write Apache Cassandra CREATE KEYSPACE and SET KEYSPACE statements
Develop your CREATE statement for each of the tables to address each question
Load the data with INSERT statement for each of the tables
Include IF NOT EXISTS clauses in your CREATE statements to create tables only if the tables do not already exist. We recommend you also include DROP TABLE statement for each table, this way you can run drop and create tables whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline
Test by running the proper select statements with the correct WHERE clause
Build ETL Pipeline
Implement the logic in section Part I of the notebook template to iterate through each event file in event_data to process and create a new CSV file in Python
Make necessary edits to Part II of the notebook template to include Apache Cassandra CREATE and INSERT statements to load processed records into relevant tables in your data model
Test by running SELECT statements after running the queries on your database
